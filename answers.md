"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"
If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

### BlockQoutes
I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

1. Cut the cheese

 1. Cut the cheese  
  Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

  Be careful when holding the knife.For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

  ### Paragraphs
   We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!
 
 ## Exercise 2
 ### KML
**Keyhole Markup Language (KML)** is an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) browsers. KML was developed for use with [Google Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth), which was originally named *Keyhole Earth Viewer*. It was created by _Keyhole, Inc_, which was acquired by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) in 2004. KML became an international standard of the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium) in 2008. Google Earth was the first program able to view and graphically edit KML files, but other projects such as [Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_(software)) have added KML support.

### XHTML
**Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)** is part of the family of XML [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)**, the language in which [Web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) are formulated.While HTML, prior to [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), was defined as an application of *[Standard Generalized Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language) (SGML)*, a flexible markup language **framework**, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.

## Exercise 4
```
public class Person{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }
  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }
  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
```
